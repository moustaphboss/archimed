## Assumptions

### Bills Generation

- **Assumption:** Initially, there are no bills. Bills are generated automatically when the bills page is accessed. The generation of bills is based on each investor's investment amount, investment date, and the fee percentage set by the company.

### Capital Calls

- **Assumption:** A capital call is due 30 days after its issue date. This is used to determine the due date of the capital calls generated by the system.
